How to sense between course and fine foam?
 - Resistive touch sensors test the force applied - could design a lever arm to dip a set amount and test force at that point?
 - IRLED & phototrasistor to test light reflecitvity or pass-through. This could either be front to back, with a "crane" that comes down over the cube, or side to side, with a lobster-like set of grabbers
 - Speaker and microphone to identify how well the sound passes through the foam
 - Measure the mass of the cube
 - Camera vision?
 
 Motion system
 - Two motorised front wheels and a castor at the back (best choice?)
 - Two motorised rear wheels and a castor at the front
 - Two motorised rear wheels and a free wheel at the front
 - Two motorised rear wheels and two front wheels with a steering rack
 - Two free front wheels and a motorised rear castor wheel with a motorised turning system
 
 Route
 - Will we go through the tunnel, over the bridge, or over the wall?
 - Will we stick to the line or follow the edge of the table?
 - What speed will we try to drive at?
 
 Sensors
 - Colour sensor for line following?
 - Accelerometer?
 - Wheel encoders?
 - Camera vision?
 - Ultrasonic distance sensors?
 - Light emmiters and receivers for detecting block types?

Block detection
- Use a long reach system to collect it from anywhere
- Use camera vision
- Use an ultrasonic distance sensor
- Try each location in turn until a block is found
